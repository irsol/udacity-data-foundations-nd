#### Data Types

**Quantitative** data takes on numeric values that allow us to perform mathematical operations (age, height, income).

**Quantitative** data types can be devided into: Continuous data type and Discrete data type.
**Continuous** quantitative values that can be split into smaller values. For example: the age, we can split age into smaller units, like years, month, days, hours, min, sec but there are still smaller units that could be associated with the age. Continuous data can take any numeric value including decimal values and sometimes even negative numbers.
**Discrete** data only takes on countable values.

**Categorical** data types are used to label a group or set of items (zip code, marital status, letter grades, rating on a survey( Poor, Og, Great)).

**Categorical** data types can be devided further into: Ordinal data type and Nominal data type.
**Ordinal** categorical values that are ranked (like scale from Very positive to Very negative).
**Nominal** categorical values that do not have ranked order (like the breeds of the dog).
