#### Dashboards and Stories

**Dashboards** allow you to analyze multiple sheets all at the same time and build filters that act over all the sheets at once.

**Stories** a feature of tableau that allows you to link together your worksheets in dashboards to give an audience a well rounded grasp of your insights.

#### Stories

Stories are great for a narrated walkthrough of the discoveries you made in your data. They are similar to dashboards in that you create sheets, then drag the sheets to the story. However, each sheet is displayed separately along with narrative text in sequential series.

Storie may not be useful if you're creting elements to a presentation outside of Tableau.
