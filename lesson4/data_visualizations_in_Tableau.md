#### What is Tableau?

Tableau makes it simple to import data from Excel, a text file, a database and other sources. Then you can easily build interactive dashboards. 

#### Connecting to data 

**The Data Interpreter** attempts to clean and format the data so that it's easier to use in Tableau.

The little icons in the header bar indicate the data type of the column. 

Tableau guesses if **numerical data** is **discrete** or **continuous** and indicates this with color, **blue** for discrete and **green** for continuous. 

Tableau doesn't always make the best guess for the data type, so you can set it manually by clicking on the data type symbol.

With string columns, you can do some simple transformations such as splitting the data into multiple columns.
