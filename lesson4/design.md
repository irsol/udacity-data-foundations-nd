From the book "Strytelling with Data" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic:

1. **Understand the context** - this means knowing your audience and conveying a clear message about what you want your audience to know or do with the information you are providing.

2. **Choose an appropriate visual display** - this was covered in the last lesson. Check out the lesson titled recap in the previous section if you need a quick refresher. 

3. **Eliminate clutter** - you should only provide information to the user that helps convey your message.

4. **Focus attention where you want it** - build visualizations that pull attention to the message you want to highlight. 

5. **Think like a designer** - you will learn a number of design principles in this lesson to assist as you start to put together your own data visualizations.

6. **Tell a story** - your visualizations should give the audience a story. The most powerful data visualizations move people to take action.
