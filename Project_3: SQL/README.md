#### Introduction

In this project, I analyzed the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store.

 I wrote a SQL query to pull the data needed to successfully answere on the questions.

 I used the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) to make the found insights easier to present.

Presentation should include:

- Four slides
- One visualization per slide
- A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
- The SQL query used to create the data used in the visualization.
