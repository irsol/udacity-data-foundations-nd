This project will introduce you to the data analysis process that you will be using throughout the rest of the Nanodegree program. In this project, you will go through the process of calculating summary statistics and building visual methods of spreadsheet data to find interesting information out about Udacity students. The goal is that you not only can perform an analysis, but also that you can communicate the results in a way that is clear and compelling.


After completing the lessons and the project, I feel comfortable with:

- Identify different datatypes to determine what analyses are possible.
- Calculate measures of center and spread to describe quantitative data.
- Use a variety of spreadsheet functionality to gain insights from data.
- Build charts and graphs to communicate the results of your analysis.
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then      
  answering those questions.
- Analyze a future dataset using Excel.
