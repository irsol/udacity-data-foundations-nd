When looking at the date as a picture, it's easier to notice patterns, like spot trends to examine more closely. 

#### Pie Charts

A pie charts is used to illustrate proportionality. Think of it as slicing the pie into pieces, where each piece matches a percentage of the whole list.

To create a pie chart in spreadsheets we need is a list of the categories and matching values such as sums or counts.

Use a pie chart to show proportionality of categories.

#### Bar Charts

Use a bar or column charts to compare category values with each other.

#### Scatter and Line Plots

Use **pie** and **bar sharts** to visualize **categorical data**.

**Line charts** visualize numerical data, such as the list of stock prices over time, a line chart gives a better picture of the data set.

**Scatter plots** are useful for displaying **bivariate numerical data**. This means a data set with two variables, such as height and weight measurements for a list of human beings.

If the data of both variables moves up together, they have a positive **correlation**.

The "trend line", which can be added in Excel by selecting the scatter chart, then Design->Add Chart Element->Trendline->Linear.

If one variable increases as the other decreases, the two variables have a **negative correlation**.

Quizz: Chart Types

- What are the relative percentages of different fruits sold this month? ==> Pie Chart

- How do the number of apples, oranges and pears sold this month compare to each other? ==> Bar Chart

- How has the price for AAPL stock changed over time? ==> Line Chart

- Is there a relationship I can see between weight and age in a population? ==> Scatter

- What is the frequency of salaries by millions across all major league baseball players? ==> Histigram

- What is the distribution of my numerical dataset from minimum to maximum, including the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartiles? ==> Box Plot

#### Histogram

Histogram a column chart thet measures the frequency of data in a data set and specifically groups numerical values into bins.

Use Analysis ToolPak Add-in on Mac.

**Histograms** and **Bar (or Column) charts** are easily confused. **Histograms** plot distributions of **quantitative (numerical) data**. Numerical ranges of the data are grouped into bins and charted. **Bar* or **column* charts plot counts of **categorical data**.
